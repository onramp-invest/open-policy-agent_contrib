# Fig autocompletion generator for opa CLI

There is a project called [Fig](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete) that lets add autocompletion support into your terminal very easily. By default, it has autocompletion support for variety of tools but it designed to be an extended way to let you add your CLI autocompletion support into it. They have a very detailed documentation to explain how you can do it if you develop your CLI tool with a popular tool called [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
